Thank you for using the Sword of the Stars 1.80 +19 save game editor, SOTSEdit.

This editor allows you to edit species, players, and planets. This ReadMe file
will briefly explain the more important details of SOTSEdit.

First, load a saved game. Sword of the Stars was written before Windows Vista,
so saved games are stored in Program Files under "sword of the stars\SavedGames".

The Summary tab shows basic game information, including game name, turn, and the
number of systems. There will be one more planet than you intended if the
Von Neuman grand menace is in the game.

The Settings tab lists players, passwords, and team. It also indicates which
players are dead, though the game doesn't trust this value if set.

The Species tab lists species (e.g. Human) and their ideal hazard ratings.
Hazard ratings are like planet temperature. Some species like it hot. You can
change that here, but be sure to make the same change to each player of the
same species or those players will suffer.

The Players tab lists each player in the game, including AI players, rogue AI
civilizations, and certain grand menace players. Here you can alter some
settings. Note that X means multiplier. In cases where a setting has a
multiplier and a scale, both are multipliers and both effect the final result.
Scale multipliers aren't effected by game technologies while X multipliers are.
If you want a consistent bonus/penalty for the entire game, change the scale.
Savings is the number of credits in your bank. Research is a measure of how
well you convert credits to technologies. IO is Industrial Output, used to
terraform, build infrastructure and ships, and run trade operations. Income is
a measure of how well civilians, IO, and trade are converted to credits each
turn. Population growth is a measure of how quickly populations grow each turn,
though populations over 100M have capped growth rates. Terraform is a measure
of how well you use IO to terraform planets. Higher is better for everything in
this tab except for Ideal Hazard.

The Planets tab lists every planet in the game, including the VN Homeworld if
present. You may notice some columns with a +. These columns are bonus columns,
which allow you to exceed normal limits. A value of -1 indicates that this
field isn't present in your save game, and can not be altered.

You may edit planet names, but note that longer names will be truncated as they
sometimes corrupt saved games. Planet size controls maximum populations, 
maximum stations, and maximum defense satellite size. Hazard controls which
species can colonize a world and at what cost. Resources greatly effect
industrial output, and can also be used for mining and refining. Asteroid and
extra resources add to a planets resources once Asteroid Mining technology is
researched. Infrastructure is a measure of how industrialized a planet is.
Imperials are core population. Civilians are secondary population, who generate
income and fill new colony ships. Owner indicates which player owns a planet,
but be careful assigning planets to other players if they've never scouted the
world. The IO columns show what planet IO is used for, and are either zero or
are not. Abandon indicates that a colony has been ordered to abandon the planet.
Destroyed indicates that a system has been annihilated by the system destroyer.
The ltis setting has something to do with when the planet was last scouted.
ltis and the Flags fields are left enabled only for advanced users, you should
never alter them. Combat control the 'recent combat' indicator, and may also
limit population growth. Larger numbers indicate more recent combat at a planet.
Addicted indicates whether a planets main race has become addicted, which
increases happiness while decreasing IO. Fleets, Gates, Station, and Monitor
indicate how many fleets, deployed hiver gates, space stations, and asteroid
monitors are present in the system.

The Actions menu allows players to quickly accomplish certain things. You may
do any of these actions manually but these features save you time. Resource
levels quickly adds resources to more barren worlds. Populations quickly adds
people to underpopulated worlds. Terraform instantly terraforms worlds to match
the owners ideal. Infrastructure quickly adds or removes industrialization.
World size quickly grows or shrinks worlds as desired. Addiction quickly cures
all addiction. Terraform dustball worlds quickly terraforms worlds which no
player can currently colonize so that someone can barely colonize them. There
is no need to fill in every field when performing an action.

When saving a game, it's always prudent not to overwrite the file you loaded!

Enjoy!
