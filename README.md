# SOTSedit
Sword of the Stars 1 save game editor

This is the best SOTS1 save game editor in existance, but has known issues.

* Tabs don't always refresh when loading a new game, just sort a column to force a refresh.
* The game parser is weak, some things don't exist in the save and show up as -1. Don't edit those cells.
* This is software I wrote in early 2011 to learn C#. It's adequate but not that well written.
